                    Greetings! I am Yassir Cherdouh, a first year student at The National School of Artificial Intelligence (ENSIA), Algiers. <br> <br>
                    I am passionate about all what touches Computer Science, in general, but more particulary three main fields : AI, CyberSecurity and Web' Dev.
                    I may not have achieved great things in this field, yet, but I plan on doing so!
                    Beyond the coding screen, I find joy in playing and watching football and playing video-games.I, also, love reading mangas and watching animes; favourite ones ? Definitely, Naruto and Haikyuu. Actually, that's where the nickname "Kodzuken" came from. <br> <br>

                    This simple website is a "mini-project" that I was planning to do in winter holidays, to practice and have a solid base of HTML & CSS before moving to JS. The oppurtunity came in, especially, after the assignement that Dr.Lounis gave us. <br> <br>
                    Certainly, throughout the year (or even years!) I will make sure to enhance the website and add more features as I keep learning to manipulate more tools, improving my level and knowledge and putting it into work.

                    In summary, I'm not just building a website; I'm building expertise. Every line of code is a step forward. I welcome any feedback or remarks concerning my work; your insights will contribute to this ongoing learning journey. <br> <br>

                    Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out!
